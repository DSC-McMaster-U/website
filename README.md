## Contribution

Everyone in the GDSC McMaster U Chapter is encouraged to contribute to this project! Please take a moment to review our contribution guidelines.

### Contribution Practices

To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Branch**: Branching can be done directly within Jira by creating a branch from your ticket. This is the easiest way to branch and ensure correct naming conventions. Ensure you branch off from the `main` branch based on your Jira ticket.

2. **Naming the Branch**: Contribution should mainly be made through feature branches off of main. Name your branch using the prefix `feature/` followed by the auto-generated ticket name.

   ```
   feature/YOUR_TICKET_NAME
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**: Make your changes and commit them to your branch. Be sure to write clear and descriptive commit messages.

4. **Push Changes**: Once you are ready, push your changes to the remote repository.

5. **Create a Pull Request**: After pushing changes, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into `main`. Be sure to link your Jira ticket in the pull request description.

6. **Review and Merge**: Your pull request will be reviewed by a team member. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `main` branch.

7. **Delete Branch**: After your changes have been merged, delete your feature branch to help keep our repository clean.
